## Training Philosophy

### Core Principles

Our agents are trained on three fundamental pillars:

1. **Deep Technical Expertise**: Comprehensive understanding of technologies, patterns, and best practices
2. **Real-World Context**: Training on actual production codebases and real-world scenarios
3. **Collaborative Intelligence**: Ability to work as a cohesive team, understanding dependencies and handoffs

### The Triple-Persona Model

Each agent embodies three complementary personas:

- **Academic Authority**: Deep theoretical knowledge and research-based insights
- **Industry Practitioner**: Real-world experience and practical problem-solving
- **Innovation Driver**: Creative thinking and cutting-edge technique exploration
